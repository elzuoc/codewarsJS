## Description
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!  
  
However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait!  That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

### Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:  
  
In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.  
  
The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

## Example
```javascript
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```
```javascript
isSquare (-1) // => false
isSquare ( 3) // => false
isSquare ( 4) // => true
isSquare (25) // => true
isSquare (26) // => false
```

## 思路
1. 以輸入來看會有 4 種邏輯：
  - 字串  ： false → String cannot be square numbers
  - 小於 0： false → Negative numbers cannot be square numbers
  - 大於 0 不可開平方根： false → {number} is not a square number
  - 大於 0 可開平方根  ： true  → {number} is a square number
